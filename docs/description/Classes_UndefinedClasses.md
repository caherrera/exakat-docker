Those classes were used in the code, but there is no way to find a definition of that class in the PHP code.

This may happens under normal conditions, if the application makes use of an unsupported extension, that defines extra classes; 
or if some external libraries, such as PEAR, are not provided during the analysis.

Otherwise, this should be checked.
